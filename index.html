    <p>
      There's no getting around the fact that we're living in dark times at the moment. What was so easy and enjoyable
      once, not that far ago, suddenly is not. The structure of our daily lives has been forced to change. Many of our
      basic human needs has had to be put on hold or minimized.
    </p>
    <p>
      We've been stuck in our homes. We can't see our friends and family in the same way. We can't hug our loved ones,
      we can't dance the night away with strangers, we can't travel to far off destinations we've dreamt of. The colors
      around us have turned to a grayscale, the light above has turned to darkness and a sense of despair is laying on
      top of hope and enthusiasm like a wet blanket. And that's rough. It's tough. We've all struggled in so many
      different ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's easy to be affected by all of this, normal even. We could all use a break, we could all use an escape, we
      could all use a spa session. Not only physically but also mentally. And that's what we in team Purple Beach Legs
      have created!

        <b>THE S.P.A.</b> is an immersive 3D audiovisual experience that will take you on a soothing and beautiful
        journey through luminescent lights, invigorating colors and dynamic shapes to some relaxing tunes. And when you
        come out on the other side you'll hopefully feel a little bit better, a little bit calmer and a little bit more
        colorful.
      </p>
      <p>
        In these dark times we have to hold on to the little moments of light we get. And we hope this experience can be
        another one of those moments. So turn off your lights, throw on your headphones and enjoy your spa session!
